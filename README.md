Project for Information Design. Simple app to display information

Hello and welcome to the app here are the steps to get this working on your machine

1) Download VS 2022
2) Install the MAUI add on (can be found in VS installer)
3) Run the application
3.5) if there are any problems that are on the lines of "could not find Maui..." 
then just wait a minute since the compiler is still going through the motions

Extra: If you want to put this on your android just select android emulator
Extra: If you want it on your iphone you need an apple developer account.
If you have one upload your developer certificate to "tools -> Xamarin -> Apple Developer"
to make it work.

Thank you for downloading the ID-IA app.

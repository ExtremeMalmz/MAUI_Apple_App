                &#10;In the third semester we see a gradual decrease of student participation even though the amount of COVID-19 cases
                &#10;remains constant. This could be attributed to burnout or a sense of being able to complete things at home
                &#10;without the need for in person lectures. In other words the third semester is an outlier, as of now. If the third
                &#10;semester is an outlier can only be determined when data has been recorded in the future semesters.
